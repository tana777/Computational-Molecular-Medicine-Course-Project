## Detection of lymph node metastases in head and neck cancer

This project is about head and neck cancers. Traditionally non-invasive methods to assess metastases in the neck lymph-nodes are not 
accurate and it is usually necessary to surgically remove the lymph-nodes to investigate the presence or absence of metastases (neck lymph-nodes dissection). 
Using Machine Learning predictive algorithms to build a more precise model could help us reduce over-treatment by sparing neck lymph-nodes 
dissection to patients who do not have metastases.
